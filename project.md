## üìã Implementation Notes

### Current Status
**Stages 1-4: COMPLETED ‚úÖ**
- Stage 1: Foundation & Setup ‚úÖ
- Stage 2: Core Pages (UI Only) ‚úÖ 
- Stage 3: Data Management Pages ‚úÖ
- Stage 4: Missing Pages (Custom Design) ‚úÖ
- **Stage 5: Real-time Integration ‚ö° IN PROGRESS**

### Next Steps
**Stage 5 will focus on page-by-page Supabase integration:**
1. Start with POS page - full real-time functionality
2. Move to Products page - complete CRUD operations
3. Continue with remaining pages in priority order
4. Test each page thoroughly before proceeding to next

### Decision Points
- Each stage requires user approval before proceeding
- UI designs must be pixel-perfect matches
- All buttons remain inactive until modal designs provided
- Real-time integration deferred until Stage 5

### Stage Dependencies
